For my project FileSorter. To make it work for you, you'll need to change the folder_path line of code (folder_path = 'C:/Users/neome/Downloads')
At folder_path you'll need to enter your own path for where you want your files to be sorted.
How I got my folder path (For Windows) was by just going in File Explore then from there go into This PC, Windows C:, into Users, then click on YOUR username folder, 
find Downloads for example, then click on the file path bar on top and copy that path or right click on the download folder and select copy path and paste it on the code:
folder_path = 'C:/Users/neome/Downloads' and run the program

For Mac, I am not sure on how to get the folder path but you can search that up and once you get it, you can copy the folder path onto the (folder_path = 'C:/Users/neome/Downloads')
line of code.
